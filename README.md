***

This is a study project. It represents a user page with a feed of this user's and other users' photos. The user is
 already logged in by default. You can't log out and create a new user here. Forms will be validated
  before submitting.

 You can edit user avatar, user name and description. You can add new photos, they will appear in the end of the feed
 . You can see more cards by scrolling down the page.
 
 Photos can be zoomed on click. It's possible to like cards and remove likes. There's a like counter. You can also
  delete the
  cards you've
  added
 . It's impossible to delete other
  users' cards.
  
  NB: Presence of empty and repeated cards is not a bug. These are other users' cards.
